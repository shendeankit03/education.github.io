        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Educational reforms are the need of the hour…..The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance” for India's track to greater development. While all the attention is on social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren't actually visible….We need to completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a 21st-century skill set should be on the key agenda list…
        For this, the first step is reducing the burden on kids by deleting stuff from the syllabus, which almost 90% is irrelevant and students actually forget sooner and leaders of tomorrow.</p>
